# penguinAI - The Joke Assistant

penguinAI is a playful spin on the original Code - OSS project. Instead of a full-featured code editor, this fork reimagines the application as a writing and joke assistant. The goal is to deliver lighthearted humor and writing prompts rather than development tools.

This repository begins from the open source [Code - OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) code base under the MIT license. The product has been rebranded for entertainment purposes and does not ship the coding features found in Visual Studio Code.

## What does penguinAI do?

* Offers joke suggestions and humorous one-liners.
* Provides prompts to help spark creative writing.
* Keeps the interface simple and fun â€“ no compilers or debuggers here!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the application using the existing build scripts. The underlying framework is still Code - OSS, so standard build instructions apply. However, expect a humorous twist instead of development workflows.

Contributions focused on jokes, puns, and witty content are welcome.

## License

penguinAI inherits the [MIT](LICENSE.txt) license from Code - OSS.
